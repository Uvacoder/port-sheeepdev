I've tried many blogging tools and platforms, many jekyll themes and much more.
But as can see I've stuck with this simple Jekyll theme called console.

I have tried the theme chirpy, but I always had problems with it.
I tried using a blogging platform called [bearblog](https://bearblog.dev) but it just wasn't for me.

I feel like using too complicated software and JavaScript is just bloat and complication, plus my programming skills are shit. [This post](https://herman.bearblog.dev/motherfucking-blog/) by Herman, creator of bearblog, summorizes it.
Just stick to simple and clean blogs.

**EDIT (6th December 2021)**
I switched to Hugo, it isn't really minimal but it fits my needs.
