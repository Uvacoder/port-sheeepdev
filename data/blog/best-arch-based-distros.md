I like to use pure arch, it is perfect for my usage case. I wouldn't suggest pure arch for newbies that have just come to linux, most of them go the debian-based route. 
But, there are some distros that are arch based and very easy for newbies that are even better then debian-based distros such as ubuntu.

Here is a list of some of the best arch-based distros in my opinion

1. Manjaro

[Website](https://manjaro.org)

Manjaro is the best distribution for beginers, it has a beautiful, customized desktop and a lot of software pre-installed.
You can pick between GNOME, KDE and XFCE (even more if you count the community versions).

Pros:
- Customized desktop
- Most of software you'll need pre-installed

Cons:
- A bit bloated if you want a minimal distro

2. EndeavourOS

EndeavourOS is a very good distribution, you have a customized desktop, you can install it even if you are not connected to the internet and it has good tutorials.

Pros:
- Customized desktop
- Offline installer
- You can pick your desktop environment

Cons:
- Online installer takes a long time to install

3. ArcoLinux

ArcoLinux is a good distribution, but it is bloated, and their website is confusing. If you dont care about the bloat I'd recommend it.

Pros:
- A lot of isos you can choose between
- Customized desktop
- You can pick your desktop environment / window manager

Cons:
- Bloated
- Confusing website

Final Toughts:

I hope you picked your distribution and enjoy arch linux :)
