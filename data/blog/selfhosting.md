First, I wanna apologize for not writing any posts, I just took a weekend to relax a bit.

In this post I wanted to say my thoughts on selfhosting

[I have a homeserver](https://sheepdev.xyz/posts/building-a-home-server/) on which I host a few services such as Nextcloud, Jellyfin and PhotoPrism

My honest opinion is that everything that you can self-host you should, with a few exceptions. I wouldn't host resource heavy stuff or just big services because they, in my opinon don't fit in with the nature of self hosting.

Conclusion:

Selfhosting is good if you think the service you want to host is perfect for hosting at home.

Sorry for the short post.
