Hi there! I'm sheep, a software developer from Zagreb, Croatia. I enjoy ricing my system and love technology and programming.

## About this website
This is my website, its my own space on the internet where I post anything that comes to mind, from blog posts to projects and updates.
I consider this website to be a part of the [Small Web](https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/), a collection of personal websites that are away from "big tech" compaines

## Privacy and Analytics
Currently, I don't use any analytics on this website. I do, once in a while, check up on the traffic via Cloudflare. That allows me to see the countries where most of my traffic is coming from.

## Technology
This website was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) SSG and the [hello-friend-ng](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) theme.

The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

## Credits
I want to give credits to some people that I ~~copied~~ took inspiration from for this website:
[Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk) and [Pukima](https://pukima.site) - [Uses](https://sheepdev.xyz/uses) page\
[Will Webberley](https://wilw.dev) - this page (about page)
