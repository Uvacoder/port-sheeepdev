Another distrohop on the ThinkPad!

This time, I tried out Gentoo Linux. It was a pain in the ass.
I did the installation [via Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN5rrCL6s1Q), *yes, that's possible*. I followed the Gentoo Handbook and successfully installed it. Then I wanted to install a desktop enviroment. I went for cinnamon but when it compiled I could not launch it. I tried compiling KDE but gave up because llvm took too long to compile. It was 2am and I was dead af, so I gave up.
