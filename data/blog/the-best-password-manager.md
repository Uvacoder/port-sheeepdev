description: Quitting Bitwarden and choosing KeePass
---

Some time ago, when I quit BitWarden, I was stuck in a loop finding the best password manager for my needs.

Then I decided to go with KeePass, and this was the best decision.

Here is a quote from their [website](https://keepass.info/help/base/index.html):
"Today, you have to remember many passwords. You need a password for a lot of websites, your e-mail account, your webserver, network logins, etc. The list is endless. Also, you should use a different password for each account, because if you would use only one password everywhere and someone gets this password, you would have a problem: the thief would have access to all of your accounts.

KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can store all your passwords in one database, which is locked with a master key. So you only have to remember one single master key to unlock the whole database. Database files are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES-256, ChaCha20 and Twofish)."

[I was previosuly self-hosting a bitwarden server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJA1F72izc), but it got impractical very fast, I needed to import HTTPS certificates, install a ton of stuff and configure a ton of stuff, it got very messy.

After deciding to remove bitwarden I chose KeePass because its pretty much the only password manager where I don't need to worry about my passwords getting leaked, or worry about setting it up on server or raspberry pi, I just store a file on my computer and voila, my passwords are all safe and encrypted on my computer, and if you have a server at home you can put the passwords file on there and sync all your passwords across many devices!

My client of choice was [KeeWeb](https://keeweb.info) on my PC and [KeePassDX](https://www.keepassdx.com/) on my phone.

And I still use KeePass to this day and will probably continue to use it for years to come!
