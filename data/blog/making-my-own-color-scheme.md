description: The making of a color scheme
---

Did you ever think of making your own color scheme? Well, I did. Recently I switched away from the [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) color scheme because I just got bored of it and I wanted to make my own color scheme.
So I did, and [Lunar](https://github.com/lunar-theme) was born. Lunar is a black and blue color scheme inspired by the colors of space. I have already made a few ports and I expect to make more soon. The concept of the color scheme is mostly inspired by [Nord](https://nordtheme.com) and [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
I expect to post some updates here on what I have made for the color scheme.
