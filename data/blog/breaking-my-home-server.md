description: The story on how I broke my home server
---

Hello everyone! I'm back.

I wanna tell you how I broke my home server 2 weeks ago.

You see, I have a [home server](https://sheepdev.xyz/posts/building-a-home-server/) on which I installed a few things on, and one of them was a RAID mirror. To control it easily I installed OpenMediaVault and I wanted to manage samba with it, but I needed to make a filesystem.

Stupid me, of course, repartitioned my Software RAID partition.

I have now reinstalled my home server with a fresh installation of Ubuntu Server, and set up samba permissions, which I hadn't done before.

Hope you enjoyed!
